# Lisseborg Recruitment App

IV1201 project

## Description

Lisseborg Recruitment App is schoolproject in the course "Arkitektur och design av globala applikationer" at KTH for group 5.
The system distinguishes between two types of users, applicants and recruiters. An applicant applies for a position within the company while a
recruiter manages applications. The system is divided into two parts: The
registration of job applications and the administration of applications.
It was not necessary to implement all the functionality but most of it was done anyway.

The project was done by using the T3 Stack which consisted the parts that can be read below.
The project was done for school but is open for future developers to keep on working with it.

2. Run "npm install" - this will install all the necessary dependencies
3. After that run "npm run dev" to get the application running.
4. Now the application should be up and running on your localhost (http://localhost:3000)
